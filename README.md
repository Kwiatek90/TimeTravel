## Introduction

This game is an interactive adventure where you take on the role of a talented archaeologist who accidentally discovers a mysterious room in Barcelona. It turns out that this is the entrance to the world of time travel. Your task is to discover the secrets of this place and save history. The game focuses on solving puzzles, exploring secret rooms and discovering artifacts that will help you activate the Time Machine.

The game uses the concepts of object-oriented programming, which means that game elements such as items, rooms and interactions are represented using classes and functions.

## Setup

You only need the appropriate version of python and its libraries,  running in your IDLE environment (I recommend Visual studio code or PyCharm)
